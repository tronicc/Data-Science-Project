    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",

    "Hacker News, a social news website, allows users to submit stories or posts. Users can vote and comment on posts in a style similar to Reddit. The more votes the likely the post is visible to other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to compare two different posts on the site Hacker News: _Ask HN_ or _Show HN_. The former is self-explanatory, users post questions seeking guidance or information. For example, which jobs are hiring and where? The latter is intended for posts that show off projects or other interesting phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, we will use this comparison to answer two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the _Ask HN_ or _Show HN_ receive more comments on average? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time recieve more comments on average? \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll only analyze a selected sample of 20,000 rows from the 300,000 rows of data available. The simplified data is comprised of posts which received comments.
